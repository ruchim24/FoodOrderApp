<b>ABOUT PROJECT</b>

This is a Online Food Ordering application UI, where user can view nearby restaurants and checkout the restaurant's menu.

This is a frontend application entirely made by using <b>React</b> library and <b>Functional Components</b>.
- Some of its cool features:
   - I have used live Swiggy apis for displaying data of restaurants and their menu.

   - Used <b>Babel</b> for transpiling.
   - Created <b>Custom Hooks</b> as well.
   - Implemented <b>Higher Order Components</b>.
   - Implemented <b>Shimmer UI</b>.
   - Used <b>Redux Toolkit</b> to design cart.
   - Used Tailwind CSS.
   - Used <b>React Testing Library</b> and <b>Jest</b> for testing.
   - Wrote testcases for Unit and Integration testing.
 
<b>What is in this application?</b>
