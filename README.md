A <b>Food Ordering App 🍕</b> in Making!!!!!

Sounds Delicious right?

<b>ABOUT PROJECT</b>

This is a Online Food Ordering application UI, where user can view nearby restaurants and checkout the restaurant's menu. 

<b>Let's Talk About Tech 💻</b>

This is a frontend application entirely made by using <b>React</b> library and <b>Functional Components</b>.
- Some of its cool features:
   - I have used live Swiggy apis for displaying data of restaurants and their menu.
   - This application is built by using <b>Parcel</b> as its bundler. Some interesting features Parcel provides are Hot Module Replacement, code optimization, code splitting, local server, dev build and lot more.
   - I have implemented <b>React Hooks</b> like useState, useEffect, useContext in this application.
   - Created <b>Custom Hooks</b> as well.
   - Implemented <b>Higher Order Components</b>.
   - Used Tailwind CSS.

<b>How to use it?</b>

- Clone this project.
- Hit <b>npm install</b> in your terminal to install all required packages.
- Run command <b>npm start</b> to start local server.
- Hit localhost:1234 in your browser.

 Voila 😉 its done.


<b>P.S.</b> This a side project I am working on and is a basic application just to hone my skills. Might add new functionalities later.
